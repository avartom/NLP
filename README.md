# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

After a sprint of Natural Language Processing, we've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. We apply newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: Yelp.

The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). The data is sampled to something more manageable for this Challenge. We analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge.

Challenge Objectives:

Part 1: Write a function to tokenize the yelp reviews

Part 2: Create a vector representation of those tokens

Part 3: Use your tokens in a classification model on Yelp rating

Part 4: Estimate & Interpret a topic model of the Yelp reviews
